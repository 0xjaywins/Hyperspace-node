# Troubleshooting
## Common Issues and Solutions
## 1. Script Fails to Run
- **Cause**: Missing dependencies (``curl` or `screen`).
- **Solution**:Install the required tools:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl screen
   ```

## 2. Insufficient RAM for Hive Allocation
- **Cause**: Your vps/PC doesnâ€™t have enough free RAM.
- **Solution**: Reduce the allocated RAM:

   ```bash
   aios-cli hive allocate 4  # Example: Allocate 4 GB instead of 9
   ```

## 3. Screen Session Issues
- **Cause**: The `screen` session might not be running.
- **Solution**:
  1. Check if the session exists:

     ```bash
      screen -ls
     ```

 2. Reattach to the session:
  
     ```bash
     screen -r hyperspace
    ```

 3. If the session is missing, restart the daemon:

     ```bash
       screen -S hyperspace -dm
       screen -S hyperspace -X stuff "aios-cli start\n"
     ```

## 4. Script Stops Unexpectedly
- **Cause**: The script might have encountered an error.
- **Solution**:
1. Rerun the script:

   ```bash
   ./hyperspace-node.sh
   ```

2. Check the error logs in your terminal for more details.

   ```bash
   screen -r hyperspace
   ```
